This project is about a hangman program that itself is going to cheat.
In a normal game of hangman, the computer picks a word that the user is supposed to guess.  
In our game of hangman, the computer is going to delay picking a word until it is forced to.  
As a result, at any given point in time there will be a set of words that are currently being used 
by the computer. Each of those words will have the same pattern to be displayed to the user.
